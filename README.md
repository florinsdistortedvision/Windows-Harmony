# What is Windows Harmony?
![cover](images/branding.png)

**"Windows Harmony"** operating system is a modification based on Windows Longhorn concepts. This project doesn't aim to fully replicate Longhorn, rather to combine some of its elements with other Aero versions of Windows (Vista & 7). This pack will allow anyone to customize their LTSC 2019 Windows (or 1809 build) into my Windows Harmony look and feel!

## Features:
- **NO** Stardock software needed (Windowblinds or other)! Free and usually trusted programs included *(minus AeroGlass, but eh sue me)*.
- Includes themes, wallpapers, cursors, system sounds (half-custom created by me, half-taken from Vista), user pictures, screensavers, icons, start menu and its skins, taskbar skins, gadget bar.
- Includes a bonus Internet Explorer 7 theme for Firefox 115ESR (installer also included) with custom interface, about box, aero compatible, icon swap, omni.ja tweaks (homepage, new tab page, inprivate page) and modified TipTab extension.
- Includes optional applications: Vista's Photo Viewer, Paint, Windows Media Player 11, Classic Sticky Notes, skinned WinFlip (Flip3D), Windows Movie Maker 6 and Windows Media Center 8.8.5.
- Includes Sample Media: Sample Music (4 tracks created by me to hear what the concept is about) and Sample Pictures (additional wallpaper-quality pictures).
- Custom Branding.
- Restored classic parts of Windows via WinaeroTweaker tweaks.

### Known issues:
- Regular taskbar will show during boot (enable the Disable_Startup_delay.reg to minimze the time to pop-up)
- Sometimes the sound flyout doesn't show (no idea why)
- Startup sound may not be triggered (disable fast startup to fix it)
- Retrobar doesn't hide the extra Network icon (make it as a moon or sun in Final tray icons using CustomizerGod)
- Setting a different locale from en_US may break some branding.

###### This pack may be applied up to 1909 for AeroGlass because the original dev of it has abandoned the project (however the icons, need manual replacement as 1903+ now used .mun/.mui resources in SystemResources instead of normal .dll in system32). 2004-22H2 users can still use the theme however without any Aero transparency.
###### Be on the look-out for a Harmony Christmas pack in December!
